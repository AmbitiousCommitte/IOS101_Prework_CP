# IOS101_Prework_CP

Hello! I'm currently diving into the IOS101: Intro to iOS Development course offered by CodePath, and this README documents my journey through the pre-work phase. The goal here is to get a solid introduction to building a simple app using Xcode and Swift, laying the groundwork for more complex projects in the future.

## 1. Setting Up Xcode

My first step in this exciting journey was to download Xcode from the Mac App Store. Luckily, a membership in the iOS Developer Program isn't required at this stage, which is great since it costs $99 a year. This step was all about getting the necessary tools without any extra costs.

## 2. Familiarizing Myself with Swift

 I started with the basics and worked my way through the introduction of Swift by exploring these resources:
- [Apple's Official Swift Guide](https://swift.org/documentation/) -> gave me a solid foundation.
- [CodePath's Understanding Swift](https://codepath.org/) -> offered me practical insights and tips.
- The [Swift 5 Playground](https://developer.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) -> allow me to get used more with Swift 5 syntax, making learning interactive and fun.

## 3. Building My First Application

The process of developing my first app was a blend of excitement and challenges. Here's a brief overview of my journey:
- **Setting up the Project:** I created a new project in Xcode, which was my first hands-on experience with the IDE.
- **Exploring Xcode:** I spent time familiarizing myself with the layout and features of Xcode, which is quite powerful and comprehensive.
- **Setting up the UI:** Adding UI elements to my app's interface was fun; I got to play around with buttons, labels, and later on changing some color.
- **Connecting UI to Logic:** This part was particularly my favorite as I start to explore how to link the UI elements to the app's logic, bringing interactivity to my app.


## 4. Planning My App

### App Brainstorming
I am not sure yet but here is my few thoughts:

- **Favorite Apps and Features:**
  - I love Instagram for its simple yet engaging UI and the way it allows for easy photo sharing and interaction.
  - I am also a fan of thread UI as it looks pretty clean
  - Similar with that but more complex is Notion, one of my favorite tools to you, with features that I can create page and note very easily
  - An app workout called Strong also my go to one as it allows me to create and time workout plan very easy, sucks that it is limited for free
  - Lastly is Linkedln, an app that I could connect to people and find opportunities for myself

- **My App Idea:**
  I'm planning to develop VietUSF Tech Hub, an app dedicated to serving the Vietnamese tech community at the University of South Florida. This platform aims to be the go-to resource for tech students and professionals to connect, share knowledge, and support each other's career growth. Key features of the app would include:
  
  - Channels for Specific Interests
  
  - Internship and Job Board
  
   - Interview Preparation
  
  - Referral System
  
  - Research Opportunities
  
  - Connect to Vietnamese Alumni Event
  
  - User Profiles
 
  - Weekly Leetcode/ Peer Project
 
  I would say it pretty similar to discord, but better UI and more fitable to share resources and connecting, could be like a middle side platform



**Improvement Ideas for My First App:**
- I plan to enhance the UI with custom fonts and color schemes, for instance the green theme of USF and Bulls
- Experimenting with more UI elements, like image views and text fields, and add some picture on it are all on my to-do list.
